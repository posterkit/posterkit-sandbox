About web fonts
===============
https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/4035/what-does-the-size-of-the-font-translate-to-exactly/8964#8964

With digital fonts, the "em height" of a font is a choice made by the font designer, and does not have to conform to this convention at all: a digital type designer can pick any foundation for their em size. However, fonts still tend to adhere, at least roughly, to the sort of convention described above. In old days when type consisted of metal blocks, the "em height" was the height of one of those blocks, which needed to be high enough not only for any character in that typeface but also for any ascenders, descenders, and accents.

Now, many modern typefaces include accents on capital letters too (such as Ä†) - these accents extend outside the traditional typographical ascender and thus these (and possibly other special characters) fall outside the top of the "em". For historical reasons we don't adjust the em size to allow these, we keep the em size and just have these extend out of it - any typographer using such accents will need to ensure there is space for them to extend into, though usually the line gap is adequate in body text.

The line gap in body text is a space left between the descender of one line of text and the ascender of the line below it - that is, the "font size" does not include this line gap measurement. It can be influenced by the CSS field line-height, where 1.4 means that the line gap is 0.4 times the em height, and thus an entire line of body text will take up 1.4 times the em height including the line gap.


How to mirror
